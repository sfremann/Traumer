# Traumer

*Winter 2023*

## Concept

_Träumer_ is a VR experience where the player embodies a character suffering from amnesia regarding the loss of a loved one. By putting themselves in the shoes of this character, the player can gradually discover their memories and remember with them the origin and nature of their grief. The experience is very metaphorical and pictorial, and is therefore subject to interpretation.

*Träumer* is a small game developed as part of a course on VR development in winter 2023 at our university *Université de Technologie de Compiègne*. Our idea was to broach the topic of grief through an immersive game with dreamlike sequences to convey emotions and a sense of grief following the 5-step model (denial, anger, negociation, depression, acceptation), using sound and visual ambiance to accompany the development of the story and introduce feelings.

## How to use

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To launch *Träumer*, you need an HTC Vive virtual reality headset with controllers (at least one), a sound device (headphones are preferable for better immersion) and a computer with the *Träumer* executable file. Next, you need to configure the room in SteamVR according to your preferred installation: standing or sitting.

  <summary>Gameplay</summary>

  Launch the Traum.exe application on your computer. Then simply put on the headset and launch the experience by touching the Play button with the VR controller. To exit the experience, remove the headset and press the Escape key on the computer keyboard.
  
  Movement is simply controlled by the controller's trackpad. Note that the speed is analogue and proportional to the position of the finger (the further it is from the centre of the trackpad, the faster the character moves).
  
  Interaction with an object is simply a matter of touching it. There's no need to press a button or trigger.

  To move forward in the game you have to interact with glowing objects. These interactions will trigger sequences and open the door to the next room.
